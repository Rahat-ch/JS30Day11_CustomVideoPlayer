# JS30Day11_CustomVideoPlayer

A very challenging one the I admittedly had to really follow along with the video to solve. This one shook my confidence a little bit, but I do feel as if I came away from it as a better coder. Learning about different event listeners was my favorite aprt of this as up until now I only ever used 'click'. It is great to see otheres right in the middle of the action. 

As usualy you can see my deployed project below:
